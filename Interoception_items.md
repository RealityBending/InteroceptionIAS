# Interoceptive Items

## Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (Murphy et al., 2020)

Below are several statements regarding how accurately you can perceive specific bodily sensations. Please rate on the scale how well you believe you can perceive each specific signal. For example, if you often feel you need to urinate and then realise you do not need to when you go to the toilet you would rate your accuracy perceiving this bodily signal as low. 

Please only rate how well you can perceive these signals without using external cues, for example, if you can only perceive how fast your heart is beating when you measure it by taking your pulse this would not count as accurate internal perception.

Scale: Strongly Agree (5), Agree (4), Neither agree nor disagree (3), Disagree (2), Disagree Strongly (1)

1. I can always accurately perceive when my heart is beating fast 
2. I can always accurately perceive when I am hungry 
3. I can always accurately perceive when I am breathing fast 
4. I can always accurately perceive when I am thirsty 
5. I can always accurately perceive when I need to urinate 
6. I can always accurately perceive when I need to defecate
7. I can always accurately perceive when I encounter different tastes 
8. I can always accurately perceive when I am going to vomit 
9. I can always accurately perceive when I am going to sneeze 
10. I can always accurately perceive when I am going to cough 
11. I can always accurately perceive when I am hot/cold
12. I can always accurately perceive when I am sexually aroused 
13. I can always accurately perceive when I am going to pass wind
14. I can always accurately perceive when I am going to burp 
15. I can always accurately perceive when my muscles are tired/sore 
16. I can always accurately perceive when I am going to get a bruise 
17. I can always accurately perceive when I am in pain 
18. I can always accurately perceive when my blood sugar is low 
19. I can always accurately perceive when someone is touching me affectionately rather than non-affectionately
20. I can always accurately perceive when something is going to be ticklish 
21. I can always accurately perceive when something is going to be itchy
