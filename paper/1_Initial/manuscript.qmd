abstract: | 
  Recent reviews demonstrate that historic questionnaires designed to assess interoceptive sensibility (i.e., the tendency to focus on and detect internal bodily sensations) show low convergence and likely measure distinct constructs. Motivated by the theoretical distinction between interoceptive accuracy versus attention, the Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS) is a recently developed, promising, and increasingly popular measure of subjective interoceptive accuracy. Across two studies, we used a mega-analytic approach combining data from 17 datasets with over 33 thousand participants to provide the most comprehensive evaluation to date of the IAS including both its structure (Study 1) and dispositional correlates (Study 2).Study 1 used exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, hierarchical clustering, and exploratory graph analysis, identifying redundant or unstable items and resulted in a robust and replicable structure, leading to a refined 14-item scale. Results suggest that rather than measuring the broad latent construct of “interoceptive accuracy” the IAS reflects 7 clusters of tightly coupled items tied to specific bodily sensations (e.g., Hunger–Thirst, Urinate–Defecate, Cough–Sneeze). Study 2 examined associations between the full IAS and its 7-item pairs to measures of interoception, mood, anxiety, psychopathology, personality, and belief-related constructs. Consistent with previous findings the IAS positively correlated with most MAIA facets and BPQ-Body Awareness, and negatively with BPQ Autonomic Reactivity, alexithymia, and interoceptive confusion. Mood showed small-to-moderate negative associations, while associations with psychopathology were selective, primarily observed for visceral item pairs. Belief-related associations were generally small. The 14-item IAS performed comparably to the original 21-item version, but item-pairing improved interpretability and highlighted domain-specific patterns. In particular, the Hungry–Thirsty and Bruise–Blood sugar items pairs had the strongest and most consistent associations to interoceptive, affective, and personality measures. Taken together, findings suggest self-perceived interoceptive accuracy is a differentiated construct, varying systematically across bodily systems. Results emphasize the importance of conceptualizing and operationalizing interoceptive processes as domain-specific and the need for context-specific and multi-dimensional interoception measures.

# Introduction

<!-- Interoception definition -->

Interoception refers to the process of sensing, interpreting and integrating information of internal bodily stimuli by the nervous system, including both internal organs (e.g., the heart, the lungs or the gut) but also more broadly physiological tissues that inform the central nervous system about the body’s current state [@khalsa2018interoception]. Although research emphasizes interoception’s fundamental role  in numerous  processes, such as emotion recognition [@terasawa2021effects] and regulation [@zamariola2019relationship], decision making [@pollatos2023interoceptive], learning [@joshi2023interoception], body-ownership [@raimo2021body] and outcomes including physical [@harrison2024interoception] and psychological health [@nord2021disrupted] along with well-being [@ferentzi2019body], the field remains hampered by concerns regarding both the conceptualization and measurement of interoception [@desmedt2025discrepancies; @desmedt2022measures; @murphy2024interoception]. 

## The Interoceptive Assessment Puzzle

<!-- Interoception measure -->

Numerous methods of assessing interoception have been developed (see @fig-measures), which can be broadly distinguished into “direct” and “indirect” approaches. Indirect approaches assess interoceptive processes by quantified by the coupling between physiological signals and cognitive or behavioural processes. At the “ability level”, such measures capture individual differences in traits related to this coupling (e.g., alexithymia) whereas at the “mechanism” level, they index psychophysiological interactions more directly (e.g., heart rate variability). 

Although these approaches do not directly measure interoceptive perception, they rely on interoceptive mechanisms and therefore provide assessment of interoceptive functioning [@wareing2024utility; @lischke2021heart]. In contrast, direct measures try to capture interoceptive processes more explicitly and encompass both “objective” and “subjective” assessments (i.e., behavioral tests of heart beat counting or tracking vs. trait questionnaires and self-reported metacognitive judgments), as well as “explicit” and “implicit” paradigms (i.e., directing participants’ awareness and attention to interoceptive processes vs. measuring interoception covertly). Measures also differ on the interoceptive modalities (e.g., cardioception, respiroception, gastroception) and theoretical dimension (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, awareness) assessed. The diversity in measurement approaches illustrates that rather than there being a ‘gold-standard’ measure of interoception in the field, each measure likely has strengths and limitations depending on the research context and dimension of interoception being assessed [@jahedi2014; @Desmedt2023accuracy].

Direct assessments can be subjective or objective, depending on whether they use conscious metacognitive appraisals or performance-based indices. Objective interoceptive tasks can be explicit (participants must consciously attend to interoceptive signals; e.g., the heartbeat counting task) or implicit (measurements of interoception are covert; e.g., heartbeat evoked potentials measured during rest). Indirect assessments evaluate constructs typically related, and ideally dependent on, interoceptive processes (e.g., physiological indices such as HRV or effect of cardiac phase) or abilities (e.g., self-report measures of emotion regulation or identification abilities."

<!-- self-reports -->
Although using self-report questionnaires to measure deeply embodied functions might seem paradoxical, recent redefinitions of interoception emphasize the importance of high-level and metacognitive elaboration of interoceptive information, and supportthe idea that some facets of interoception, including participants’ metacognitive beliefs, can be subjectively assessed [@khalsa2018interoception; @suksasilp2022towards].. 

Indeed, the fact that self-reported interoception reflects a fundamentally different aspect of conscious interoceptive processing compared to objective task measures, is thought to be central to understanding the reported lack of convergence between objective and subjective measures [@desmedt2022measures]. For instance, there are typically weak or no correlation between questionnaires and objective measures [HCT, @schandry1981heart] and the Heartbeat Detection Task [HDT, @kleckner2015methodological], even when both measures are intended to capture the same theoretical interoceptive dimension [e.g., task-based accuracy vs. self-reported accuracy, @murphy2019; @brand2023; @arslanova2022]. 

Perhaps more surprisingly, there is also a reported lack of convergence across both objective and subjective measures: objective measures purporting to measure the  same interoceptive dimension, such as accuracy, show no or weak correlation [respectively, @brand2023; @hickman2020relationship], and subjective questionnaire measures are only weakly correlated with each other [@vig2022questionnaires]. As well as posing substantial validity concerns,  these findings raise the possibility that even within broad measurement domain, different measures are  targeting fundamentally different facets of interoception, undermining replicability and hindering theoretical and empirical progress in the field.

The lack of convergence among self-reported trait measures of interoception, also called “interoceptive sensibility” [i.e., the tendency to focus on and/or accurately detect interoceptive signals; @garfinkel2015knowing; @khalsa2018interoception], is particularly striking and problematic.  A recent systematic review suggested that various questionnaires designed to assess interoceptive sensibility may, in fact, measure distinct constructs, with the risk of researchers treating them as equivalent despite overall low convergence [@vig2022questionnaires; @desmedt2022measures].  

<!-- In this framework, self-report measures are categorized into interoceptive sensibility and interoceptive self-report scales (i.e., the ability to evaluate one's personal experiences of internal bodily states, assess their consequences, and articulate them through speech or movement). -->
Several widely used questionnaires were included in the review, such as the Body Perception Questionnaire [BPQ, @porges1993body], the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness [MAIA, @mehling2012; MAIA-2, @mehling2018multidimensional], the Body Awareness Questionnaire [BAQ, @shields1989body], the Private subscale of the Body Consciousness Questionnaire [PBCS, @miller1981consciousness], and the Self-Awareness Questionnaire [SAQ, @longarzo2015self] which comprised 86% of all citations. The lack of correlations to moderate correlations among questionnaires measures suggests that rather than measuring a common construct they likely capture different aspects of interoception, emphasizing the need for greater conceptual clarity regarding what each measure captures, how they relate to different dimensions of interoception, and their potential overlaps with other constructs, such as alexithymia and body awareness. One avenue for addressing these issues is the careful investigation of newer measures that were not included in prior reviews.

## The Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS)

<!-- Introducing the IAS -->

Focusing on the accuracy dimension of interoceptive sensibility, a recently developed scale with a rapidly growing popularity is the Interoceptive Accuracy Scale [IAS, @murphy2019]. The authors developed the IAS to clarify not only how interoception is measured, but also what is being measured. Whereas many existing interoceptive models [e.g., @garfinkel2015knowing; @khalsa2018interoception] conflate interoceptive accuracy and attention, Murphy and colleagues conceptualise these as distinct dimensions. As a result, individuals may report attending to internal bodily signals while simultaneously recognising that their perception of these signals is inaccurate. This distinction represents a conceptual advance in the measurement of interoceptive sensibility and positions the IAS as the only tool specifically designed to assess subjective interoceptive accuracy.

The IAS comprises 21 Likert-scale items that query how accurately one can perceive different bodily signals, with one item per physiological modality such as respiration (“I can always accurately perceive when I am breathing fast”), heart (“I can always accurately perceive when my heart is beating fast”), skin (“I can always accurately perceive when something is going to be ticklish”), arousal or bodily functions like coughing (“I can always accurately perceive when I am going to cough”) or urinating (“I can always accurately perceive when I need to urinate”). Appealingly, the IAS’ items are about specific interoceptive behaviors and “objective” experiences (albeit subjective reports of them), a distinct difference compared to other popular interoception questionnaires, such as the MAIA-2, which contains more general and metacognitive items (e.g., “I trust my body sensations”, “I can notice an unpleasant body sensation without worrying about it”), as well as dimensions related to attention and emotion regulation (e.g., Not-distracting and Not-worrying subscales respectively).

<!-- IAS structure  -->
The original IAS validation study suggested a two-factor structure: one reflecting the perception of interoceptive signals (urinate, hungry, defecate, thirsty, pain, heart, taste, breathing, temperature, muscles, affective touch, vomit, sexual arousal), and the other comprising signals that are either difficult to perceive solely through interoceptive information or reflect socially unacceptable bodily functions (itch, tickle, cough, burp, bruise, blood sugar, sneeze, wind). The authors highlight the imperfect fit of the 2-factor structure [@murphy2019, p. 127], with  several subsequent  studies identifying different optimal solutions and interpretations. @brand2023 reported a 1-factor solution to be the best fit, whereas  @lin2023 and @campos2021 found bifactor solutions [i.e., one general factor above a set of lower-level factors, @rodriguez2016evaluating] to be the best fit. Using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), and constraining the solution to two factors to remain consistent with the original validation, @koike2023 identified a different 2-factor structure that differentiated cutaneous (itching, tickling, coughing, burping, affective touch, bruising, passing gas, sneezing, muscle sensations, sexual arousal, and taste) and visceral sensations (urination, defecation, hunger, thirst, pain, breathing, fatigue/blood sugar, temperature, vomiting, and heartbeat).

As well as differences in the optimal factor structure of the IAS, there has also been discussion regarding the specificity of individual items. For instance, @murphy2019 note that while some items measure direct interoceptive signals such as cardioception, others likely capture phenomena that are difficult to detect solely through interoceptive signals (e.g., “bruising” might be detected through skin discoloration; p. 119). @lin2023 highlight several psychometric limitations, including five locally dependent pairs and three items (touch, blood sugar, bruise) with exceptionally high difficulty and low discrimination, suggesting further refinement of IAS items to improve precision. Localization issues also arose, with both “itch” and “tickle” corresponding to the same Chinese character, leading to their collapse into a single item [@lin2023]. Additionally, @campos2021 suggested that the IAS is predominately a unidimensional scale with all 20 items (with the exception of “tickle”)  reflecting a  general factor. 

<!-- Relationship with other interoception measures -->

Regarding its validity, the IAS has been compared to other interoception-related measures. It shows  positive correlations with most MAIA facets [@mehling2018multidimensional; @gaggero2021] except for the Not-Distracting and Not-Worrying subscales [@brand2023], subscales  previously highlighted as related to non-interoceptive abilities [@ferentzi2021examining]. Comparisons between the IAS and the body awareness dimension of the BPQ, have been mixed: some studies report small positive correlations [@brand2023; @koike2023; @gaggero2021], while others find small negative correlations [@lin2023], a quadratic positive relationship [@campos2021] or no correlation at all [@murphy2019]. Positive correlations have been observed for four of the five subscales from the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ, @baer2006using; @brand2023; @koike2023].  

Additionally, the IAS is positively correlated with the interoceptive awareness subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory [EDI-IA, @lin2023] and a negatively correlated with the Interoceptive Confusion Questionnaire [ICQ, @brewer2016alexithymia;  @brand2023; @murphy2019]. Finally, supporting the distinction between interoceptive accuracy and attention, IAS’ correlation with the Interoceptive Attention Scale [IATS, @gabriele2022dissociations] is typically small [@lin2023; @koike2023].

<!-- Convergent validity (correlates)  -->

Although assessing the predictive validity of an interoception scale may be theoretically challenging, expected negative associations have been consistently observed between the IAS and alexithymia [@brand2023; @koike2023; @campos2021; @murphy2019; @lin2023], somatic symptoms [@brand2023; @koike2023; @lin2023], depressive symptoms [@brand2023; @koike2023; @lin2023], anxiety [@brand2023], neuroticism [@brand2023] and self-esteem [@murphy2019].

Taken together, these findings support the IAS as measuring an adaptive aspect of interoception, although its pattern of associations with other interoception (or interoception-related) questionnaires indicate overlap across various theoretical dimensions.  This further highlights limitations of strictly orthogonal models of interoception and the possibility of its faithful capture by questionnaires. Accordignly, while the IAS shows promise, the findings underscore the need for further refinement which the present paper seeks to address. 


<!-- current study -->

Given increasing interest in interoception across psychology and neuroscience, and the growing use of the IAS, careful scrutiny of this novel self-report measure of interoceptive accuracy is warranted. Therefore, the current study has two aims. First, to clarify the structure of the IAS using a mega-analytic approach which leverages existing data by aggregating existing datasets and re-analyzing them at the raw data level. This aggregated data will then be used to contrast the traditional CFA/SEM factor-based analyses and  Hierarchical Clustering Analysis (HCA) with newer network-based ones (Exploratory Graph Analysis). By utilizing conceptually distinct analytical frameworks, the current paper aims to provide a more nuanced and method-independent view of the IAS factor structure, allowing the identification of both convergent and potentially overlooked structural features that may not be apparent when relying on a single analytic approach. Second, to provide an overview of construct validity and the dispositional correlates of the IAS, clarifying its general pattern of associations with interoception-related constructs, mood, psychopathology and other relevant measures and thereby situating interoception questionnaires within a broader context.


# Study 1

Study 1 re-analyses and assesses the factor structure of the IAS by re-analyzing the raw data across 17 open-access datasets [@brand2023; @campos2021; @lin2023; @murphy2019; @arslanova2022; @todd2022; @gaggero2021; @brand2022; @von2023; @poerio2024interoceptive; @petzke2024somatic]. Combining these studies has the advantage of providing more robust and generalizable understanding of the IAS’ factor structure. However, given that studies differ in their sample size, demographic characteristics, language, and procedure, we also provide an individual study analysis (i.e., applying the same method on all samples separately) to add nuance to the general picture.

## Methods

### Datasets

Our search focused on studies citing the original IAS validation paper [@murphy2019] which identified 136 papers (as of 01/05/2024). To qualify for inclusion, papers needed to provide open-access to raw data and report individual IAS items scores.  A total of 17 datasets were used, including data from five unpublished studies (see **Table 1**). The total number of participants across these datasets was 33,526 participants (Mean = 47.96 $\pm$ 13.1, 71.3\% Female).

### Data Analysis

Psychometrically good items should exhibit various qualities, such as validity, reliability and discrimination, to which one of the contributing factors is the amount of inter-individual variability captured by an item. IAS Items to which most participants’ answers are concentrated around one option - i.e., exhibiting a narrow distribution - were flagged as potentially problematic.

<!-- UVA -->
After examining the distributions and correlations of IAS items, we tested for “redundant” items (e.g., due to multicollinearity or local dependency) using Unique Variable Analysis [UVA, @christensen2023unique], a novel method derived from network psychometrics to identify and merge items that share substantial variance (which can distort the structure estimation). We used a conservative threshold of 0.30 that detects “large” to “very large” overlap between items and only suggest scale modifications if strongly justified.

Following the analysis of items, we analyzed the factor structure of the IAS using three different approaches, each with particular trade-offs and assumptions, to provide a multi-verse picture of likely solutions. Specifically, we applied traditional exploratory and confirmatory Factor Analysis (EFA/CFA), hierarchical clustering (HCA), and Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA), to both the whole sample and each dataset separately (details being available in the analysis document at https://github.com/RealityBending/InteroceptionIAS). Decisions and conclusions consider both overall and dataset specific results. 

<!-- EGA -->

EGA is a novel framework that combines network analysis with psychometric methods [@golino2017exploratory] to jointly estimate the number of dimensions (i.e., groups of items) as well as the structure stability of a scale [@golino2017exploratory; @golino2020investigating]. EGA is a considered a suitable but still comparable and interpretable alternative to traditional factor analysis that addresses some of its limitations, including the assumption of a “latent” source of variability, possible biasing in  optimal factor number estimation by sample size [@christensen2021equivalency]. Additionally, when compared to other factor retention methods such as Kaiser criterion and parallel analysis, EGA performed better in estimating number of factors in complex population structures, such as bi-factor solutions [@jimenez2023dimensionality]. At a fundamental level, EGA conceptualizes items as nodes in a network, with connections (edges) between nodes reflecting associations between items. Clustering of nodes reveals distinct communities of related items, in practice akin to traditional latent factors albeit without explicitly assuming their presence [@christensen2021equivalency]. We used the EGAnet package [@christensen2021estimating] to fit a hierarchical EGA with the Leiden community detection algorithm.

<!-- Factor Analysis -->
Although EGA is an attractive and robust alternative to traditional factor analysis, factor analysis remains a widely used method for dimensionality assessment. Since  our goal was to provide a general,  yet nuanced picture of IAS factor structure, with capability to  show potential discrepancies depending on analysis methods used, we also include traditional EFA/CFA here. Unlike EGA, factor analysis assumes that a latent source of variability (i.e., a common latent variable)  underlies the observed set of manifest variables [@cosemans2022exploratory]. A critical step in factor analysis is determining the optimal number of factors, for which we used the Method Agreement Procedure [@ludecke2021performance], a consensus-based decision method based on multiple factor estimation methods applied concurrently.

<!-- HCA -->

Finally, we also applied Hierarchical Clustering Analysis [HCA, @murtagh2014ward], which unlike factor analysis, does not assume any latent source of variability, but instead iteratively groups items based on their similarity (e.g., correlation) into a hierarchy of clusters. The benefits of HCA include its interpretability and ability to capture complex relationships among items without relying on strict assumptions about data distribution or latent variables.

<!-- CFA -->
In a typical 2-step fashion, initial analyses were conducted, followed by structure refinement via item selection, with the  final item pool  tested for a second time. Additionally, various solutions (e.g., adding general factors) were statistically compared using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA).

## Results

<!-- Distributions of items -->

The distribution of the items across samples suggested a consistent modal value (@fig-distributions, top panel), such that participants are most likely to answer 4/5 (i.e., agree) on all IAS items except “blood sugar” and “bruise”, which show a different distributional pattern with a lower mode (~2/5). 

While this difference is not problematic per se, the contrasting distributions might be indicative of items with non-homogeneous psychometric “difficulty”, potentially due to difficulty in inferring and reporting them. **Consistently with @sorokowska2021affective,** lower mode responses were also observed for “affective touch” in samples the Chinese versions, indicating translation or cultural discrepancies. More generally, the response spread (i.e., scale coverage) was narrow (which can limit  psychometric sensitivity), with a particularly low occurrence of extreme values (1 and 5), and a strong mode with most responses clustering around 4 (assuming the IAS is implemented as a 5-point Likert scale following its validation). Samples using an analogue response scale (samples 10, 11 and 12 in @fig-distributions) displayed a more continuous spread of answers, seemingly improving the interindividual variability, although potentially displaying a secondary lower mode at ~2 suggesting the existence of potential clusters of participants. The correlation matrix between all items (see Figure 2, bottom panel) shows an overall positive correlation pattern, with highly correlated item pairs (e.g., Tickle-Itch, Urinate-Defecate, Pain-Wind, Hungry-Thirsty) and triplets (e.g., Vomit-Sneeze-Cough, Temperature-Muscles-Pain).

<!-- UVA -->
UVA flagged two strongly redundant variables, “itch” and “tickle” indicating to remove the latter. We removed “tickle” from further analysis due to its high redundancy (and because it is absent from some datasets due to translation issues). Several more item pairs were flagged as moderately redundant (“wind” and “burp”; “urinate” and “defecate”) and mildly redundant (“sneeze” and “cough”; “heart” and “breathing”; “hungry” and “thirsty”). These patterns were observed consistently across most individual samples.

HCA highlighted item pairs and triplets that were consistently grouped together across samples, such as “wind” and “burp”, “sneeze” and “cough”, “itch” and “bruise”, “urinate” and “defecate”, and “pain”, “muscles”, and “temperature”. This pattern was largely replicated with EGA, with the additional presence of a unique cluster comprising “sex arousal”, “affective touch”, “temperature”, “pain”, “muscles”, and “taste”. EFA suggested an optimal 3-factor solution with one factor comprising expulsion-related items (“burp”, “wind”, “cough”, “sneeze”, and “vomit”), a second factor comprising visceroceptive items (“heart”, “breathing”, “hungry”, “thirsty”, “urinate”, and “defecate”), and a third factor comprising items that are not directly accessible via internal bodily sensations alone (“bruise” and “blood sugar”). Results on the structure of the full scale (excluding “tickle”) are presented in the **Supplementary Materials.** 

<!-- We discarded: -->

<!-- Taste: Lone item + unstable -->
<!-- Affective_touch: Cross-loadings + unstable -->
<!-- Vomit: Less strongly associated -->
<!-- Itch: Less strongly associated, did not form consistent cluster -->
<!-- More controversial: Temp and Sex_arousal: similar cluster yet less reliable -->

Importantly, these initial structural analyses highlighted six problematic items in addition to “tickle” identified from UVA. “Taste” typically displayed a lone or unstable pattern of associations, “affective touch” exhibited cross-loadings and instability, “vomit” was weakly associated with other items, and “itch” did not form a consistent cluster. Finally, “temperature” and “sexual arousal” showed redundant patterns of associations but were less reliable. These 6 items as well as “tickle” were removed, and a second run of structural analyses were performed on the remaining 14 items (summarized in @fig-structure).

<!-- Second run -->
HCA and EGA yielded highly consistent results, emphasizing seven item pairs: Hungry-Thirsty, Bruise-Blood sugar, Urinate-Defecate, Muscles-Pain, Breathing-Heart, Cough-Sneeze, Wind-Burp. HCA also meaningfully grouped the Urinate-Defecate and Muscles-Pain pairs, and expulsion items pairs (Wind-Burp and Cough-Sneeze). EFA again suggested an optimal 3-factor solution with the first factor comprising expulsion-related items (“burp”, “wind”, “cough”, “sneeze”), the second factor comprising the Urinate-Defecate pair, and the third factor comprising the remaining items.

### Step 2

<!-- CFA -->
We fitted and compared various candidate structures emerging from the previous analyses, including a 1-factor model (the G-model), a 3-factor model (EFA), a 3+1 model (EFA + general factor), a 5-factor model (HCA), a 5+1 model (HCA + general factor), a 7-factor model (EGA), and a 7+1 model (EGA + general factor), using CFA. The EGA model with 7 factors of item pairs provided the best fit to the data with the lowest RMSEA (0.035), lowest $\chi^2$ (2,334.112), and highest CFI (0.984). This was followed by the EGA + general factor model (RMSEA = 0.054, $\chi^2$ = 6,876.395, CFI = 0.952), and then the HCA model with 5 factors (RMSEA = 0.078, $\chi^2$ = 13,441.878, CFI = 0.906). All other models performed poorly, with RMSEA > 0.08 and CFI < 0.90. The EGA model yielded the lowest BIC (which considers the number of factors), followed by the EGA plus a general factor model. All other models displayed significantly (BIC-based Bayes Factor < 1/100) lower evidence for their structures compared to the EGA model.

Across individual datasets, the EGA model provided the best fit to the data in 8 out of 13 samples for which the CFA converged. In these samples, the 7-factor EGA model showed excellent performance, with low RMSEA values (≈ 0.025–0.057), high CFI values (≥ 0.95), and substantially lower $\chi^2$  values compared to alternative models. Adding a general factor improved model fit in three samples, for which the 7-factor EGA + general factor model showed acceptable RMSEA (≈ 0.048–0.061) and CFI (≈ 0.929–0.957) values. In two samples, the 5-factor plus general factor model provided the best fit, with acceptable RMSEA values (0.049 and 0.057) and CFI values (0.955 and 0.919). Bayes factor comparisons aligned with BIC-based conclusions; taken together, these results suggest that although the EGA model was preferred in most samples, bifactor models (i.e., EGA and HCA models with a general factor) provided evidence for a common IAS factor in some samples. 


## Discussion

<!-- Aim and previous factor structures -->
Study 1 aimed to systematically evaluate the structure of the IAS. Previous research reported conflicting models, from unidimensional [@brand2023] to bifactor [@campos2021; @lin2023] or two-factor solutions [@murphy2019; @koike2023]. Concerns about specific items (e.g., low discrimination, local dependencies, and items reflecting phenomena less accessible to interoception) prompted a mega-analytic approach using both factor-analytic and network-based methods.

<!-- Item pairs and optimal structure -->
Analyses revealed that seven item pairs (e.g., Hunger–Thirst, Urinate–Defecate, Cough–Sneeze) provided a robust and replicable structure, leading to a refined 14-item IAS. These pairs consistently emerged across datasets and yielded superior fit indices compared to alternative models. This suggests that the IAS does not measure a broad latent construct of interoceptive accuracy but reflects clusters of tightly coupled items tied to specific bodily sensations.

<!-- Implications for scale interpretation -->
The presence of redundant or unstable items (e.g., Tickle, Taste, Affective Touch) undermines interpretability and likely explains inconsistencies in prior factor-analytic findings [@campos2021; @lin2023]. Nevertheless, the structured item pairs correspond to intuitive bodily domains - visceral, expulsion, musculoskeletal - supporting ecological validity. These findings highlight the need for targeted scale refinement and motivate future development of context-sensitive, multidimensional interoception measures.

<!-- Summary -->
In summary, study 1 suggests that once problematic items are removed, the IAS is best conceptualized as a set of item clusters rather than a unidimensional scale. This structural insight provides the foundation for Study 2, where dispositional correlates are examined to further evaluate the IAS's construct validity.

# Study 2

Building on the structural findings from Study 1, the second study turns to the validity of the IAS by examining its dispositional correlates. Although the IAS has been widely used, evidence regarding its associations with personality traits, affective dispositions, and related psychological constructs remains scattered and inconsistent [@murphy2019; @brand2023; @lin2023; @todd2022]. Study 2 therefore had two primary goals. First, to provide a robust overview of the dispositional correlates of the IAS by leveraging the large number of available datasets. Second, to evaluate the practical benefits of using the refined 14-item version of the scale identified in Study 1, compared to the original 21-item unidimensional solution, in order to assess whether structural improvements translate into clearer and more reliable external associations.

We selected measures that appeared in multiple datasets from Study 1 and/or were relevant given the scope of the study, i.e., constructs related to physiology, mood, personality, psychopathology, and beliefs and misbeliefs. We merged scores of regular and abridged versions for conciseness where applicable.

#### Interoception

Interoception-related measures included the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Version-2 [MAIA-2, @mehling2018multidimensional], the Body Perception Questionnaire Short Form [BPQ-SF, @cabrera2018assessing], and the Interoceptive Confusion Questionnaire [ICQ, @brewer2016alexithymia]. We also included the Toronto Alexithymia Scale [TAS-20, @bagby1994twenty], and the Bermond–Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire [BVAQ, @vorst2001validity], due to the close relationship between interoception deficits and alexithymia.
<!--
The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Version-2 [MAIA-2, @mehling2018multidimensional] is a 37-item questionnaire assessing eight dimensions of interoception: Noticing, Not-Distracting, Not-Worrying, Attention Regulation, Emotional Awareness, Self-Regulation, Body Listening, and Trust. Responses are rated on a 6-point Likert scale (e.g., "I notice when I am uncomfortable in my body").

The Body Perception Questionnaire Short Form [BPQ-SF, @cabrera2018assessing] contains 46 items measuring Body Awareness and Autonomic Reactivity on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., “My heart often beats irregularly”). The very-short form (BPQ-VSF) contains 12 items from the Body Awareness subscale. For this study, scores from both versions were combined.

The Interoceptive Confusion Questionnaire [ICQ, @brewer2016alexithymia] consists of 20 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., “I cannot tell when my muscles are sore or tight”) assessing difficulties in interpreting non-affective physiological states, such as pain or hunger.

The Toronto Alexithymia Scale [TAS-20, @bagby1994twenty] contains 20 items rated on a 5-point forced-choice scale (e.g., “I have feelings I can't quite identify”), divided into three dimensions: difficulty identifying feelings, difficulty describing feelings, and externally oriented thinking.

The Bermond–Vorst Alexithymia Questionnaire [BVAQ, @vorst2001validity] consists of 40 items across five subscales: fantasising, identifying, analysing, verbalising, and emotionalising. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale. The BVAQ also provides two higher-order factors, namely affective and cognitive (e.g., “I like to tell others how I feel”). -->

<!-- Mood and Anxiety -->
#### Mood and Anxiety Related
Scores from depression and anxiety-related measures were included due to their established associations with interoceptive processing [@khalsa2018]; namely  the Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II, @beck1996beck], the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 [PHQ-4, @kroenke2009ultra], the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9, @kroenke2001phq], the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 [PHQ-15, @kroenke2002phq], the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire [MFQ, @angold1995development], the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory Trait Version [STAI-T, @spielberger1970manual; and STAIT-T, @zsido2020development], and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7, @spitzer2006brief], and General Anxiety Disorder-2 [GAD-2, @kroenke2007anxiety] - obtained from the PHQ-4.

<!-- 
The Beck Depression Inventory-II [BDI-II, @beck1996beck] is a 21-item measure of depressive symptom severity, including psychological (e.g., guilt) and physiological (e.g., loss of energy) components. Items are rated on a 4-point scale (e.g., “I feel sad much of the time”).

The Patient Health Questionnaire-4 [PHQ-4, @kroenke2009ultra] is a 4-item screening tool for depression and anxiety, rated on a 4-point Likert scale (e.g., “Little interest or pleasure in doing things”; “Not being able to stop or control worrying”). The PHQ-2 [PHQ-2, @kroenke2003patient] and General Anxiety Disorder-2 [GAD-2, @kroenke2007anxiety] scores were combined with the PHQ-4 scores.

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9, @kroenke2001phq] includes 9 items assessing depressive symptoms on a 4-point Likert scale (e.g., “Feeling tired or having little energy?”).

The Patient Health Questionnaire-15 [PHQ-15, @kroenke2002phq] assesses somatic symptom distress with 15 items rated on a 3-point scale (e.g., “Over the last week, how often have you been bothered by back pain?”).

The Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire [SMFQ, @angold1995development] is a 13-item measure of recent depressive symptoms in children aged 6–17, rated on a 3-point scale (e.g., “I felt miserable or unhappy”).

The State–Trait Anxiety Inventory Trait Version [STAI-T, @spielberger1970manual] is a 20-item trait anxiety questionnaire rated on a 4-point Likert scale (e.g., “I worry too much about something that really doesn't matter”). Scores from the shorter version of the STAIT-5 [@zsido2020development] were combined with the STAI-T.

The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale [GAD-7, @spitzer2006brief] is a 7-item measure of generalized anxiety symptoms rated on a 4-point Likert scale (e.g., “Not being able to stop or control worrying”). -->

<!-- Psychopathology -->

#### Psychopathology
Dimensional psychopathology-related scores were included from the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Short Form [PID-5-SF, @thimm2016personality], the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire – Brief Revised [SPQ-BR, @davidson2016schizotypal], the McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder [MSI-BPD, @zanarini2003zanarini], and the Autism Spectrum Quotient Short Form [ASQ-S, @hoekstra2011construction].

<!-- The Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Short Form [PID-5-SF, @thimm2016personality] consists of 25 items rated on a 4-point Likert scale, measuring five domains: disinhibition, antagonism, detachment, negative affect, and psychoticism (e.g., “Plenty of people are out to get me”).

The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire – Brief Revised [SPQ-BR, @davidson2016schizotypal] contains 32 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale, assessing four primary dimensions: cognitive-perceptual, interpersonal, disorganized, and social anxiety. These are subdivided into nine secondary factors, including constricted affect, eccentricity, magical thinking, lack of close friends, odd speech, referential thinking, social anxiety, suspiciousness, and unusual perceptions (e.g., “Plenty of people are out to get me”).

The McLean Screening Instrument for Borderline Personality Disorder [MSI-BPD, @zanarini2003zanarini] is a 10-item dichotomous screening measure for borderline personality disorder (present/absent; e.g., “Have any of your closest relationships been troubled by a lot of arguments or repeated breakups?”).

The Autism Spectrum Quotient Short Form [ASQ-S, @hoekstra2011construction] is a 28-item measure of five autistic traits: social skills, adherence to routines, cognitive flexibility, imagination, and patterns/numbers. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale (e.g., “I find it difficult to work out people's intentions”). -->

<!-- Personality -->
#### Personality
Personality-related measures included the NEO Five-Factor Inventory, Neuroticism subscale [NEO-FFI, @costa1992personality], the Mini International Personality Item Pool [MINI-IPIP6, @sibley2011mini], and the Big Five Inventory Short Form [BFI-S, @rammstedt2007measuring].

<!-- The NEO Five-Factor Inventory, neuroticism subscale [NEO-FFI, @costa1992personality] is a 12-item measure of neuroticism, assessing the general tendency to experience negative emotions such as fear, sadness, or disgust. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., “I often feel inferior to others”).

The Mini International Personality Item Pool [MINI-IPIP6, @sibley2011mini] includes 24 items measuring six broad traits: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Openness, Extraversion, and Honesty-Humility. Items were scored on visual analogue scales in our samples (originally 7-point Likert scales; e.g., “Have a vivid imagination”).

The Big Five Inventory Short Form [BFI-S, @rammstedt2007measuring] is a 10-item measure of the Big Five traits, rated on a 7-point Likert scale (e.g., “I see myself as someone who … is considerate and kind to almost everyone”). -->

<!-- Beliefs and Misbeliefs -->
#### Beliefs and Misbeliefs
Beliefs- and misbeliefs-related measures included the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale [GCBS, @brotherton2013measuring], the Primal World Beliefs Inventory [PI-99, @clifton2019primal] and its short form [PI-18, @clifton2021brief], and the Lie Scale [LIE, @makowski2023structure]. These instruments assess individual differences in conspiracist, world, and lying beliefs. This domain represents a novel avenue of research in the context of interoception, as such beliefs have not been previously assessed in relation to interoceptive processes.

<!-- The Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale [GCBS, @brotherton2013measuring] is a 15-item measure assessing five dimensions of conspiracy beliefs: government malfeasance, extraterrestrial cover-up, malevolent global conspiracies, personal wellbeing, and control of information. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., “Secret organizations communicate with extraterrestrials, but keep this fact from the public”).

The Primal World Beliefs Inventory [PI-99, @clifton2019primal] is a 99-item measure assessing 26 high-order beliefs about the world. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale (e.g., “Nearly everything in the world is beautiful”) The PI-18 [@clifton2021brief] is a short form of the orginal questionnaire assessing the 4 main world beliefs: the world is Good (vs. Bad) and its three dimensions: Safe (vs. Dangerous), Enticing (vs. Dull), and Alive (vs. Mechanistic). Scores from the PI-18 scores were combined with the PI-99.

The Lie Scale [LIE, @makowski2023structure] is a 16-item measure of lying tendencies across four components: Ability, Frequency, Negativity, and Contextuality. Items are scored on visual analogue scales (e.g., “I am a good liar”). -->

```

<!-- Preprocessing and standardization -->
All variables from the 16 open-access datasets will be extracted and standardized (z-scored). Scores were harmonized and combined were meaningful (e.g., scores from the short 18-item form of the PI and scores from its longer 99-item version). Missing data was excluded on a per-model basis, to maximize statistical power. 

<!-- Multilevel modelling approach -->
The approach chosen to approach the estimation of the multiple associations, while takin into account study heterogeneity and propagate its variable uncertainty was to treat datasets as clusters (random groups), and compute pooled estimates of the associations that account for both within- and between-sample variability, akin to a meta-analytic framework.
Specifically, associations were estimated using mixed models implemented in the *glmmTMB* package [@glmTMB], and postprocess with the *easystats* R ecosystem [@ben2020effectsize; @ludecke2020extracting; @makowski2025modelbased]. Each predictor was entered separately (note that the focus is the effect size and confidence interval, and not the *p*-value, thus preventing concerns of multiple hypothesis testing), with the seven IAS item pairs identified in Study 1 (Hungry–Thirsty, Muscles–Pain, Wind–Burp, Urinate–Defecate, Breathing–Heart, Bruise–Blood, Cough–Sneeze) and the original IAS "total" score serving as outcomes. Models included the dataset as random intercept and the predictor as a random slope. 
<!-- When models failed to converge, a reduced structure with random intercepts only will be used.  -->


<!-- Extraction of parameters -->
From each fitted model, we will extract standardized regression coefficients (intepretable as a correlation index), and 95% confidence intervals (details on *p*-values, convergence status, and effective sample size are included in the Supplementary Materials), and the results are reported in @fig-correlations. We report the mean coefficient in the text when consistent across measures.
<!-- Note that for Participants identifying as “Other” will be excluded from analyses due to limited representation. -->

## Results

<!-- Demographic correlates -->

Age showed consistent positive standardized associations across IAS correlates (mean β = .13), with all effects significant. Gender displayed near-zero effects (mean β = −.06), significant only for the Hungry–Thirsty, Wind–Burp, and Urinate–Defecate pairings.

<!-- Interoceptive measures -->

MAIA subscales showed robust positive standardized effects with the IAS. Noticing yielded the strongest association (mean β = .26), followed by Attention Regulation (mean β = .25) and related subscales - Body Listening, Trusting, Emotional Awareness and Self-Regulation, each in the .19–.24 range, all significant. Effects were generally strongest for the full IAS, except for Body Listening, which peaked for the Bruise–Blood pairing. Not Distracting was weakly and significantly only for the full IAS, Hungry-Thirsty, Bruise-Blood sugar and the Muscles-Pain pairings (β ≈ −.02 to .06). Not Worrying was significant only for the full IAS and the Hungry–Thirsty and Urinate–Defecate pairings (β ≈ −.01 to .04).

The BPQ's Autonomic Reactivity subscale was reliably negative across pairings (mean β = −.19), reaching significance for all except the Bruise–Blood sugar and Breathing–Heart pairings. In contrast, Body Awareness was positive and significant across most pairings  (mean β = .15; range = .10 to .22) with the exception of Wind-Burp and Urinate-Defecate.

Interoceptive deficits showed consistent negative associations: Alexithymia measures (TAS, BVAQ) were robustly negative (β ≈ −.13 to −.2), except for the BVAQ Affective subscale, which was positive for Bruise–Blood (β = .16). Interoceptive confusion (ICQ) was also negative across all IAS measures (mean β = −.32; range = −.49 to −.20).

<!-- Mood-->

Depression (mean β = −.20) and anxiety (mean β = −.20) showed consistent negative associations across the IAS and its pairings, with the strongest effects observed for the Hungry–Thirsty dimension. However, different measures showed some divergence: the MFQ was largely nonsignificant except for a notable effect in the Breathing–Heart pairing, while somatic concerns (PHQ-15) were unrelated to the total scale but showed weak negative associations with the Hungry–Thirsty, Bruise–Blood sugar, and Urinate–Defecate pairings (from −.22 to −.05). Other mood indices (PHQ-9, PHQ-4, GAD-7) produced generally weaker but often reliable negative coefficients (typically −.10 to −.15), though effects sometimes appeared only for specific pairings (e.g., PHQ-4 nonsignificant for Wind–Burp and Breathing–Heart). Across measures, the Hungry–Thirsty pairing consistently yielded the strongest standardized effects.

<!-- Psychopathologies -->

Autistic traits (ASQ) were generally negatively associated with IAS scores. Among ASQ subscales, Imagination (mean β = −.18) exhibited the most consistent pattern of negative associations across pairings, with the exception of Cough–Sneeze. The strongest full-scale effects were driven by the Hungry–Thirsty, Bruise–Blood sugar, and Muscles–Pain pairings, which yielded the largest negative coefficients.

A comparable trend was observed for maladaptive personality traits. Detachment, Psychoticism, and Negative Affect demonstrated the most reliable, albeit weak, negative associations with the IAS scores (from −.08 to −.10), again primarily driven by the Hungry–Thirsty, Bruise–Blood sugar, and Muscles–Pain pairings. Other maladaptive traits were unrelated to IAS scores. Notably, Antagonism was the only trait to show a significant positive association, limited to the Bruise–Blood sugar pairing (β = .14), whereas Borderline Personality was uniquely associated with Hungry–Thirsty (mean β = −.14).

Schizotypal traits showed a similarly negative pattern of associations. Social Anxiety (mean β = −.11) and No Close Friends (mean β = −.12) displayed the most consistent effects. Although some facets were unrelated to the total IAS score, they were associated with specific pairings: Unusual Perceptions with Muscles–Pain and Urinate–Defecate, and Eccentric with Hungry–Thirsty and Urinate–Defecate.

<!-- Personality and beliefs -->

<!-- TO INCLUDE? Although associations between personality and interoception have been less frequently explored than those involving mood or psychopathology, previous research has identified links between neuroticism and extroversion and interoceptive sensibility using the MAIA and BPQ measures. This study therefore included extended personality measures to clarify the broader relationships between interoception and personality traits beyond neuroticism and extraversion [@pearson2022two]. -->

Among the Big Five traits, Openness (mean β = .10), Agreeableness (mean β = .08), and Conscientiousness (mean β = .11) exhibited small yet consistent positive effects, most evident for the total IAS score. Extraversion showed a weak but positive association, driven primarily by its stronger relation to the Bruise–Blood pairing (β = .17). In contrast, Honesty–Humility (mean β = −.10) demonstrated a small negative effect, most evident for the Hungry–Thirsty and Bruise–Blood sugar pairings. Finally, Neuroticism (mean β = −.23) was negatively associated with the IAS, with the strongest effect observed for the Hungry–Thirsty pairing (β = −.22).

Primal world beliefs were largely null, with small positive associations for appraising the world as being "Understandable", "Alive", and "Hierarchical", with Hungry–Thirsty (β = .09). Appraising the world as "Good" was uniquely positively related with Muscles–Pain (β = .09). Within the Lying Profile, only Lying Contextuality showed a modest negative coefficient for Bruise–Blood (β = −.12). Global Conspiracies (GCBS) beliefs were associated with the total IAS and three pairings (mean β = .10).
<!-- Personal Wellbeing with the full scale and the Hungry-Thirsty (mean β = .09), and Information Control (β = .06) with Cough–Sneeze. -->

<!-- Differences between the full IAS and item pairings -->

Overall, the original IAS total score produced the greatest number of significant standardized effects (28), though many were driven by specific pairings rather than uniform scale-wide associations. Hungry–Thirsty (17) and Bruise–Blood sugar (10) consistently yielded the strongest standardized coefficients, especially for interoception, mood, and psychopathology measures. Other pairings (Cough–Sneeze, Wind–Burp, Urinate–Defecate) contributed little unique variance and rarely yielded meaningful standardized effects. 


## Discussion

<!-- Aim and conceptual focus -->

Study 2 examined the dispositional correlates of the IAS and whether the refined 14-item version with subdimensions offers practical advantages over the original 21-item scale, using a meta-analytical approach leveraging large statistical power. The findings clarify the conceptual boundaries of self-reported interoceptive accuracy and underscore the domain-specific nature of these standardized associations.

<!-- Interoception and correlates - item specific -->
The IAS showed positive associations with most MAIA facets, except for the Not-Distracting and Not-Worrying subscales, replicating prior findings [@brand2023; @todd2022]. Associations with the BPQ Body Awareness subscale were consistent with previous reports on positive association between these measures [@brand2023; @koike2023; @gaggero2021], whereas indices of autonomic reactivity were more strongly and negatively associated with IAS scores, supporting earlier observations that reactivity may reflect aspects of bodily signal processing captured by self-reported interoceptive accuracy [@todd2022]. In contrast, measures of interoceptive difficulties, including alexithymia and interoceptive confusion, were negatively associated with IAS scores, consistent with prior research [@brand2023; @koike2023; @lin2023; @murphy2019]. 

Although associations between the IAS and the BPQ subscales replicated prior work, interpretation remains uncertain due to conceptual ambiguity in the BPQ–Body Awareness subscale. Prior studies have reported non-existent [e.g., @murphy2019], negative [@lin2023], and even quadratic relationships [e.g., @campos2021], and some authors have suggested that these mixed findings stem from divergent interpretations of the items—specifically, whether they capture attentional focus on bodily sensations or perceived accuracy in detecting them [e.g., @gabriele2022dissociations; @campos2021]. Thus, although we observed a positive association between the BPQ–Body Awareness and the IAS, this result should be interpreted with caution, and future studies should assess participants' understanding of BPQ items to clarify the nature of this relationship.

Across mood, most item pairings displayed small-to-moderate standardized coefficients, indicating shared variance between interoceptive self-reports and affective tendencies, aligning with previous findings [@murphy2019; @koike2023]. In contrast, associations with psychopathology were more selective: negative associations were primarily observed for visceral pairings such as Hungry–Thirsty and Bruise–Blood sugar, whereas other domains yielded weaker or nonsignificant effects. This pattern suggests that self-reported interoceptive accuracy is more strongly associated with affective and clinical traits for visceral sensations than for somatic or respiratory reflexes.

<!-- Personality, worldview, and boundaries of interoception -->

Associations with personality traits followed a similar domain-specific structure. Effects for the full IAS largely reflected contributions from specific pairings: Extraversion showed its strongest associations for Bruise-Blood sugar, Neuroticism and Honesty–Humility for Hungry–Thirsty, and Openess, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness for the full scale. These results indicate that associations between interoceptive self-report and personality dimensions may depend on the bodily domain represented.

Associations with belief systems were uniformly small. Weak positive associations emerged between the IAS and certain primal world beliefs (e.g., perceiving the world as comprehensible or alive) and selected conspiracy belief dimensions, particularly Global Conspiracies and Personal Wellbeing. These effects were limited to specific pairings, most often Hungry–Thirsty and Bruise–Blood sugar, indicating that links between interoceptive self-report and broader cognitive or worldview constructs are modest and domain-specific.

<!-- Short IAS benefits and summary-->
In summary, the 14-item IAS performed similarly to the original 21-item version, showing comparable patterns of association with mood, psychopathology, and interoceptive measures. Although associations between the IAS and external constructs were typically captured by the original score, they were often not uniform across bodily domains and driven by specific item pairs. In particular, the Hungry–Thirsty and Bruise–Blood sugar items pairs showed the strongest and most consistent relationships with interoceptive, affective, and personality measures, whereas other pairs contributed little unique information, particularily in measures of psychopathologies and beliefs.
The homeostatic salience and universality of the former pair, and the contextual relevance and visual/psychological promiennce of the latter, might contribute to their stronger associations with dispositional traits. Overall, these findings suggest that the shorter scale captures domain-specific patterns, offering a more efficient, nuanced, and interpretation-precise measure of self-reported interoceptive accuracy.

# General Discussion

<!-- Aims -->
The present study leveraged a number of existing datasets to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the IAS, examining both its structure (study 1) and its dispositional correlates (study 2). These studies offer novel insights into the conceptual interpretation, and practical applications of the IAS. In this discussion, these findings are contextualized within the broader landscape of interoception research.

<!-- Structural insights from Study 1 -->

Study 1 re-analysed the IAS using complementary psychometric and network-based approaches. Across samples, seven stable item pairings emerged (Hungry–Thirsty, Urinate–Defecate, Muscles–Pain, Breathing–Heart, Cough–Sneeze, Wind–Burp, and Bruise–Blood sugar), yielding a refined 14-item structure with superior fit and cross-dataset stability compared to previously proposed unidimensional or bifactor models. These results challenge interpretations of the IAS as a single latent construct [e.g., @brand2023; @murphy2019] and instead suggest that it is best described as capturing multiple, interrelated but domain-specific clusters of bodily sensations.

Unlike @lin2023, whose 12-item solution supported unidimensionality, the present findings suggest that local dependencies between items reflect meaningful theoretical coupling among functionally related sensations (e.g., Heart–Breathing). Such clustering likely mirrors the way bodily signals co-occur physiologically or phenomenologically (e.g., hunger with thirst, coughing with sneezing) and are therefore perceived and evaluated together. Perceived accuracy in one bodily system may generalize to conceptually or functionally linked sensations, yielding a clustered rather than continuous organization of interoceptive beliefs. 

Consistent with this interpretation, self-reported interoceptive awareness across related bodily axes (e.g., cardiac and respiratory) tends to show positive associations [@garfinkel2016interoceptive], whereas objective measures of interoceptive accuracy across modalities typically show weak or absent correlations [@bruni2023interoception; @ferentzi2018interoceptive]. This dissociation indicates that actual interoceptive abilities are largely domain-specific, while subjective interoceptive beliefs generalize across functionally related systems. Accordingly, the present clustering likely reflects the conceptual organization of interoceptive beliefs, structured by perceived bodily interdependence, rather than a single general interoceptive capacity.

<!-- Dispositional correlates and domain specificity (Study 2) -->

<!-- Interoception and interoception-related -->
Study 2 extended these findings by examining the IAS's associations with interoceptive, affective, personality, and belief-related traits. Consistent with prior work, the IAS correlated positively with adaptive aspects of interoceptive sensibility (e.g., MAIA subscales reflecting noticing, attention regulation, and body trust) and negatively with interoceptive difficulties, namely alexithymia and interoceptive confusion [e.g., @brand2023; @garfinkel2015knowing; @gaggero2021].

<!-- Mood and psychopathological disorders domain specific -->
Across dispositional constructs, individuals reporting higher symptoms of depression and anxiety tended to perceive themselves as less accurate in detecting bodily signals, in line with previous findings [e.g., @brand2023; @khalsa2018; @nord2022interoceptive]. Crucially, these associations were not uniform across bodily domains: the strongest, and most robust, effects involved drive-states (e.g., hunger, thirst), whereas regulatory systems, such as cardiorespiratory and expulsion domains showed weaker or inconsistent relationships. This domain specificity suggests that beliefs about one's gastrointestinal accuracy may be more psychologically and clinically relevant than beliefs about reflexive or surface sensations, and/or that the experience of these sensations is more salient and thus easier to accurately appraise, leading to meaningful variation across individuals.

This pattern may help clarify inconsistencies in the literature linking interoception and emotion. Reviews and meta-analyses report that performance-based measures of interoceptive accuracy, usually cardioception, often show weak or absent correlations with depression and anxiety [@jenkinson2024interoception; @banellis2025interoceptive; @adams2022association]. In contrast, self-reported interoceptive measures, which contain items relevant to multiple bodily domains, typically show stronger, often negative, associations with internalizing traits [e.g., @brand2022; @lin2023; @clemente2024relationship]. 

These discrepancies likely reflect both conceptual distinctions between perceptual accuracy and metacognitive self-belief [@khalsa2018; @garfinkel2015knowing; @suksasilp2022towards] and variation in the bodily domains assessed. The present results extend this framework by demonstrating that associations between interoceptive self-beliefs and affective traits are concentrated in psychologically salient visceral domains. Thus, the field's heavy reliance on cardioceptive tasks may have obscured more meaningful relationships in other interoceptive modalities.

<!-- Psychopathology -->
Beyond mood, similar though weaker - patterns emerged for autistic traits, schizotypy, and maladaptive personality dimensions. These traits tended to correlate negatively with self-perceived interoceptive accuracy, particularly within visceral and musculoskeletal domains, while showing little or no association in other areas. This selective pattern suggests that diminished beliefs in bodily perception may contribute to specific social–emotional and personality features, rather than reflecting a general interoceptive deficit. 

These results align with previous evidence showing that interoceptive self-beliefs are meaningfully related to emotional awareness, social connectedness, and psychopathology [@torregrossa2022interoceptive; @williams2023characterizing; @brand2022]. The present findings extend this literature by showing that these associations are domain-specific rather than global across bodily systems.

Taken together, these findings suggest that self-perceived interoceptive accuracy is a differentiated construct, varying systematically across bodily systems. Beliefs about gastrointestinal sensations, in particular, show the most consistent associations with affective and dispositional features. Although modest in magnitude, these effects underscore the value of considering domain-specificity when linking interoceptive beliefs to emotion and mental health.

<!-- Methodological and applied considerations -->
Methodologically, combining traditional psychometrics with network-based approaches proved valuable. EGA complemented, and often surpassed, factor analysis by identifying meaningful inter-item dependencies, producing a more interpretable and stable structure. The refined 14-item IAS balances parsimony and predictive validity, illustrating how network-informed scale refinement [@golino2017exploratory] can enhance construct clarity.

The IAS nonetheless remains limited in scope. Pairing items improved interpretability and outperformed an overall score of self-reported interoceptive accuracy in associations with affective and dispositional traits, but dimensions with only two items (one per bodily domain) remain suboptimal, particularly for constructs that are broad or conceptually ambiguous [@allen2022single], such as beliefs about interoceptive accuracy across multiple bodily systems.

Because perceived accuracy in one system can generalize to conceptually or functionally related sensations, two-item clusters may overemphasize these links and fail to capture variability across unrelated domains, while overall scores risk obscuring meaningful relationships.This limitation is especially important given that researchers may assume interoceptive abilities generalize across bodily domains, when in fact they do not. Building on @desmedt2022measures' observation of a "jingle fallacy" in using self-reported interoceptive measures, the present findings extend this caution by highlighting that assuming beliefs replicate across domains constitutes a similar caveat.

Additionally, the IAS items lack contextual specification (e.g., physiological vs. affective triggers). For instance, a racing heart could signal anxiety or exercise; without context, it is unclear which state participants referenced from. Such ambiguities may constrain ecological validity and contribute to variability across studies [@vlemincx2023novel]. Expanding item content and adopting context-specific phrasing will be important for future measurement development to more comprehensively capture interoceptive beliefs.

Clinically, the domain-specific structure of the IAS highlights that interoceptive disruptions in affective and psychopathological conditions may center primarily on beliefs about visceral sensations rather than global interoceptive deficits. This perspective suggests new routes for targeted assessment and intervention focusing on specific bodily domains.

<!-- Limitations and future directions -->
Nonetheless, the current work is not without its limiations. This study focused exclusively on the IAS and did not evaluate the structure or subjective correlates of other commonly used interoception questionnaires, such as the BPQ or MAIA. Because the IAS uniquely targets interoceptive self-reported accuracy our focus was on its structure and correlates rather than introducing established measures with documented shortcomings [@ferentzi2021examining; @rogowska2023validation; @campos2021; @vig2023self].

Another limitation is the lack of objective measures of interoceptive accuracy in this study. Incorporating cardiac, resporatory, and gastric performance-based measures would allow investigation of how beliefs about one's interoceptive accuracy relate to actual performance. Such comparisons could clarify whether domain-specific self-reports reflect true perceptual sensitivity or primarily capture metacognitive and conceptual beliefs. Although prior research has shown weak or absent correlations between subjective and objective measures within the same domain [e.g., cardiac accuracy vs subjective accuracy, @brand2023; @petzke2024somatic; @arslanova2022], examining additional modalities, such as gastric perception, could reveal whether these patterns generalize across other interoceptive systems.

<!-- Conclusion -->
In summary, the present study both underlines the IAS as a solid measure of self-reported interoception, yielding typical patterns of associations with external measures, and challenges its optimal structure and scoring approach, suggesting that a refined 14-item version with seven item pairs might prove more useful in capturing domain-specific interoceptive beliefs., avoiding further adding to the conceptual confusion of interoception research.
