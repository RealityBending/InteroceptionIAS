<!-- Interoception definition -->

Interoception is referred to the process of sensing, interpreting and integrating information pertaining to internal organs, such as the heart, the lungs or the gut [@khalsa2018].
While recent research emphasizes a key role of interoception in a variety of processes (e.g., emotion regulation, decision making) and of outcomes (physical and psychological well being), the field remains clouded by concerns about how interoception is assessed.

[**TO DO**: add - previous work suggests the importance of physiological contexts (Vlemincx et al., 2021)]
**I  would rather put that in the discussion in the suggestions for better scales**

<!-- Interoception measure -->

Various measures of interoception have been developed (see **@fig-measures**), forming a combination of "objective" and "subjective" assessments (i.e., physiological tasks such as the heart beat counting or tracking vs. questionnaires and subjective scales involving a metacognitive reflection), "explicit" and "implicit" paradigms (i.e., directing participants' awareness and attention to interoceptive processes *vs.* measuring interoception unbeknownst to them), various interoceptive modalities (e.g., cardioception, respiroception, gastroception) and theoretical dimensions (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, awareness).
While there is no consensus as to which particular approach provides the most accurate and "pure" measure of interoception and interoceptive abilities (assuming it is a unidimensional construct), it is instead plausible that each measure has strengths and limitations, and a utility dependent on the context and goal at hand [@jahedi2014].

<!-- self-reports -->

For instance, while the use of subjective self-reports questionnaires to measure deeply embodied functions might seem paradoxical, recent redefinitions of interoception, emphasizing the role of high-level and metacognitive elaboration of interoceptive information, has provided the theoretical grounding to support the idea that some facets of interoception (including participants' metacognitive beliefs) can be assessed subjectively, providing useful and interesting measures [@murphy2019; @lin2023].
**TODO: that's a long sentence consider splitting**
The notion that self-reports might not reflect the same processes as other interoception measures is important to contextualize the apparent lack of convergence between measures in the field [@desmedt2022measures]. **(TODO: I would talk here a bit more about the relationship and lack thereof with intero tasks rather than later)**
A better understanding of what is being measured with different questionnaires and dimensions, as well as their potential overlaps with other constructs (e.g., alexithymia, body awareness), is thus needed to clarify the role of self-reports in the assessment of interoception.


<!-- Introducing the IAS -->

<!-- was the second reference asked for the MAIA, the MAIA-2 ? -->

A recently developed scale with a rapidly growing popularity is the Interoceptive Accuracy Scale [IAS, @murphy2019].
The IAS consists of 21 Likert-scale items that query how accurately one can perceive different bodily signals, with one item per physiological modality such as respiration (*"I can always accurately perceive when I am breathing fast"*), heart (e.g *"I can always accurately perceive when my heart is beating fast"*), skin (e.g *"I can always accurately perceive when something is going to be ticklish"*), arousal or bodily functions like coughing (e.g *"I can always accurately perceive when I am going to cough"*) or urinating (e.g. *"I can always accurately perceive when I need to urinate"*).
Interestingly, the IAS' statements are about specific interoceptive behaviours, which is a notable difference with other popular interoception questionnaires, such as the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness scale [MAIA, @mehling2012; MAIA-2, @mehling2018multidimensional], which contains more general and metacognitive items (e.g., *"I trust my body sensations"*, *"I can notice an unpleasant body sensation without worrying about it"*).

<!-- IAS structure  -->

Although the original validation study suggested a two-factor structure for the IAS (**TODO: what are they?**), the authors underline its acceptable but imperfect fit [@murphy2019; p. 127], calling on further investigation of the scale's factor structure.
Notably, the only other validation study to report a 2-factor solution was conducted by @koike2023, who performed an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) assuming 2 factors to align with the findings from the original validation paper.
**TODO: this above is not really a validation study showing 2 factors is good if they prespecified two to match the original?**
Other follow-up studies using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural modeling [@morin2016] have identified different optimal solutions. 
Some studies, like @brand2023, reported a 1-factor solution, while @lin2023 and @campos2021 found bifactor solutions - one general factor and a set of lower-level factors [@rodriguez2016evaluating] - to be the best fit.
**TODO: what does morin2016 found? I would cite it after saying what they found rather than here**

Discussions have also been focused on specific items. For instance, @murphy2019 notes that some items might measure direct interoceptive signals such as cardioception, while others might capture phenomena not perceivable through interoceptive signals alone (e.g., "bruising"; p. 119). 
@lin2023 also highlights their correlation analysis, showing five locally dependent pairs and three items (touch, blood sugar, bruise) with exceptionally high difficulty and low discrimination. 
Additionally, @campos2021 suggests that the "tickle" item represents a more specific *(separate?*) factor.
Interestingly, @lin2023 reported that all items of the IAS grouped together using a new approach, Exploratory Graph Analysis [EGA; @golino2017exploratory], to assess convergent and discriminant validity, providing further evidence for unidimensionality.

<!-- Relationship with other interoception measures -->

The IAS has naturally been compared to other interoception-related scales, and shows a positive correlations with most facets of the MAIA **(TODO: MAIA should be introduced before)**, except for the Non-Distracting and Not-Worrying subscales [@brand2023]. Interestingly, findings on the correlation between the IAS and the body awareness dimension of the Body Perception Questionnaire [BPQ-A, @porges1993body] have been mixed: some studies report small positive correlations [@brand2023; @campos2021; @koike2023], while others find small negative correlations [@lin2023] or no correlation at all [@murphy2019]. Small positive correlations have also been observed with the "observation" and "description" subscales of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ, @baer2006using; @brand2023; @koike2023], as well as with the "non-reactivity" and "acting with awareness" subscales [@koike2023]. Additionally, the IAS has shown a positive correlation with the interoceptive awareness subscale of the Eating Disorder Inventory [@lin2023] and a negative correlation with the Interoceptive Confusion Questionnaire [ICQ, @brewer2016alexithymia; @brand2023; @murphy2019]. Lastly, small positive correlations have also been reported with the Interoceptive Attention Scale [IATS, @gabriele2022dissociations], though studies have also found no correlation between these measures [@gabriele2022dissociations] **(TODO: why same reference for two contradictory claims?)**.

<!-- TO BE COMPLETED -->

<!-- Convergent validity (correlates)  -->

While assessing the validity of an interoception scale can be conceived as theoretically challenging, several measures have been used to assess convergent validity for the the IAS, including expected negative associations with alexithymia [@brand2023; @koike2023; @campos2021, @murphy2019; @lin2023], somatic symptoms [@brand2023; @koike2023, @lin2023], depressive symptoms [@brand2023; @koike2023; @lin2023], anxiety [@brand2023], neuroticism [@brand2023] and self-esteem [@murphy2019]. 
<!-- **anything else?**. TO BE COMPLETED -- to be determined -->



<!-- Moreover, the current subjective measures do not correlate well with the objective measures [@murphy2019]. -->

Few studies have examined the correlation between objective interoceptive measures, such as the Heartbeat Counting Task (HCT; Schandry, 1981) and the Heartbeat Detection Task (HDT; Kleckner et al., 2015). Existing findings report weak correlations for the HCT (Murphy et al., 2019), no correlations except for the sensitivity variable of the HCT (Brand et al., 2023), and small correlations for the HDT (Brand et al., 2023). These results suggest that the IAS, a subjective measure, does not strongly align with objective interoceptive assessments.

<!-- current study --> 

The current study aims at 1) clarifying the structure of the IAS with a meta-analytic approach that leverages existing data and contrast the traditional CFA/SEM factor-based analyses with network-based ones such as EGA.
2) The second part will provide an overview of the dispositional correlates of the IAS, providing an overview of the pattern of associations that is key to better understand the nature, place and role of interoception questionnaires within a larger context.

## Study 1

The goal of study 1 is to re-analyse and assess the factor structure of the IAS by taking advantage of the large number of open-access datasets [@brand2023; @campos2021; @lin2023; @murphy2019; @arslanova2022; @todd2022; @gaggero2021; @brand2022; @von2023].
While combining these studies might provide a more robust and generalizable understanding of the IAS' factor structure, we also additionally provide an individual analysis (i.e., on all samples separately) to add nuance to the general picture, as all studies differ in their sample sizes, demographics, language, and procedure.

### Methods

#### Datasets

Our search focused on studies citing the original IAS validation paper [@murphy2019], identifying 136 papers (as of 01/05/2024).
To qualify for inclusion, papers needed to (1) provide accessible data in open-access, (2) employ the IAS as a measure, and (3) report individual IAS items scores.
A total of 10 studies was included (see **Table 1**).
We also included the data of two unpublished (but already open-access) studies from the authors and one from another author.
The total N participants was 32,214 participants (*Mean* = 48.6 years, *SD* = 13.1, 71.6% Female).

#### Statistical Analysis

To examine the factor structure of the IAS, a two-step approach was employed.
First, Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA), was used to estimate the dimensions via network estimation and community detection, alongside assessing the stability of dimensions and items using the bootstrapping techniques [@golino2017exploratory].
The selection of EGA was motivated by its capability to handle complex, multidimensional data and provide robust dimension estimates.
A novel network psychometrics - Unique variable analysis [UVA; @christensen2023unique] - approach based on the weighted topological overlap will be computed to evaluate which items have substantial local dependence (> 0.25).
Subsequently, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was employed followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).
